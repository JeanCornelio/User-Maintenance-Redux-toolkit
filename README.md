# Redux Toolkit + React + TypeScript + Vite + Flowbite React

This project is a simple User Maintenance system built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Flowbite React. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a list of users, such as adding, editing, deleting users and optimistic UI. The application utilizes a modern front-end stack and leverages the component styling of Flowbite React for a sleek and responsive UI.
